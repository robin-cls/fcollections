    Given a Tree (ex a filesystem) with a structure of N homogeneous levels,

    For example, let's consider a set of altimetry data files, organized in
    pre-defined folders: v1/Expert/cycle_001, v1/Expert/cycle_002,
    v2/Basic/cycle_001, ...
    The first level contains information about the version, the second level
    about the subset, and the last level about the cycle number. The layout will
    declare three FileNameConvention to 'know' about the tree structure. Then,
    filters - for example subset='Expert' - can be set to select only a subpart
    of the tree, greatly improving the visitation performance.
